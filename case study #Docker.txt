  Introduction 
With the shift toward cloud-native infrastructure and DevOps practices, Docker has emerged as a game-changer. Its containerization model allows businesses to package applications with all dependencies, ensuring consistent behavior across environments. 
In this post, we’ll explore why top companies adopt Docker, how it integrates with RHEL 9 (Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9), and the concrete benefits they derive from it. 
 
  Why Docker with RHEL 9? 
RHEL 9 is known for its enterprise-grade stability, security features (SELinux, System Roles), and container readiness (podman, buildah). While Podman is Red Hat’s default container engine, many companies still prefer Docker due to: 
•	Easier developer onboarding 
•	CI/CD compatibility (Jenkins, GitHub Actions) 
•	Broad community and image support (Docker Hub) Now let’s dive into real-world case studies. 
 
  Case Study 1: Spotify — Microservices at Scale Use Case: 
Spotify needed to scale dozens of microservices quickly without worrying about OS inconsistencies. They containerized their backend services using Docker on Ubuntu and later ported builds to RHEL for production stability. 
Benefits: 
•	94% faster deployment times 
•	Improved rollback and version control 
•	Developers use Docker locally while RHEL 9 powers secure staging and prod 
 
  Case Study 2: ADP — Consistent Development Environments Use Case: 
As a payroll and HR software giant, ADP runs thousands of services. Developers often struggled with environment drift. Docker offered a standard interface for building and running code. Benefits: 
•	Unified build pipeline using Dockerfiles 
•	RHEL 9 systems ensure hardened security in prod 
•	Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Docker Compose & Ansible 
 
  Case Study 3: Walmart Labs — Faster DevOps Workflows Use Case: 
Walmart Labs needed a robust solution to handle seasonal traffic spikes and quick A/B testing. Docker allowed isolated, reproducible environments for every feature branch. 
Benefits: 
	• 	Reduced testing setup time by 70% 
•	Used Docker Swarm on RHEL nodes before shifting to Kubernetes 
•	Improved CI/CD feedback loop using Jenkins + Docker agents 
 
  Case Study 4: Machine Learning Startups — Reproducibility & Portability Use Case: 
ML teams at startups like Hugging Face use Docker to package models and dependencies (PyTorch, TensorFlow, CUDA) into a single container. 
Benefits: 
•	Model training on RHEL 9 GPUs via nvidia-docker 
•	Environment reproducibility across devs and servers • 	Easy migration to cloud platforms (AWS, Azure)
